OpenBook is a clone of popular social cataloging site GoodReads.

OpenBook was built using a React-Redux frontend architecture with a Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL database backend.

### Key Features
* User Authorization
* Books
* Reviews
* Bookshelves

Users can create an account, or log in to one of they've already created. Once authorized users can browse, rate and review books. Reviews are dynamically compiled into an average score for the book. Users can save books they like to their bookshelves, filing them as 'read', 'to-read, or 'currently-reading'. Future functions include adding a social aspect such as viewing other users bookshelves and liking reviews.
